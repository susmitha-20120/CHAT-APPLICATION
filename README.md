**This project is a real-time chat application built using Node.js, Express, and Socket.IO. The goal of the application is to enable users to send and receive messages instantly through a web-based interface. The chat system allows multiple users to communicate in real time, simulating the core functionality of modern messaging platforms like WhatsApp, Discord, or Slack.

##The backend server is powered by Express.js, which serves the frontend and manages WebSocket connections using Socket.IO. When a user sends a message, it is instantly broadcast to all connected clients without requiring a page refresh. This is made possible through the use of WebSockets, which provide a persistent two-way communication channel between the client and server.

##On the frontend, a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface enables users to:

.Enter a username upon joining

.Type and send messages

.View messages from other users with usernames

.Experience instant updates across all open chat instances (multi-tab or multi-user)

The UI includes clean, modern styling with message bubbles and color-coded usernames for improved readability. Users are prompted for their name when joining, and each message is displayed in the format:
[Username]: [Message]

##This project demonstrates:

.Setting up a Node.js server

.Handling real-time events with Socket.IO

.Serving static files (HTML, CSS, JS) from an Express server

.Managing client-server communication efficiently

.Designing a responsive, user-friendly frontend chat interface

##Features:
.Real-time messaging using WebSockets

.Unique username prompt for each user

.Modern UI with styled chat bubbles

.Responsive across multiple users/tabs

.Simple and lightweight structure

##Technologies Used:
.Node.js – Runtime environment

.Express.js – Web framework

.Socket.IO – Real-time communication

.HTML/CSS/JavaScript – Frontend interface




##This project serves as a foundational example of how real-time web applications work and can be extended to include advanced features like private messaging, chat rooms, message persistence (with a database), and user authentication.
